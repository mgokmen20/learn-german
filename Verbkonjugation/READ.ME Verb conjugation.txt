I made a German verb conjugation game by visually replicating a German board game entirely using HTML, CSS, and JS. In the game, there are actually two dice; one displays numbers from 1 to 6, and the other shows colors. The player rolls the dice and conjugates the verb corresponding to the number and color horizontally and vertically. I stayed true to the original game and didn't add new verbs, but new verbs can be added. Later, if I find time, I can add boxes that show the correct answers, or you can add them yourself.
